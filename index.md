# Alcino Cunha

I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Informatics](http://www.di.uminho.pt) of [University of Minho](http://www.uminho.pt). I'm also a member (and currently co-coordinator) of the [High-Assurance Software Laboratory](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/centres/haslab), a research center of [University of Minho](http://www.uminho.pt) and of the [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt) associate laboratory.

## Research

My research aims to help developers build more reliable software. Together with several collaborators at [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt) and [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en/centers/toulouse), I'm currently developing a new formal specification language and analysis tool for software design - the [Electrum](http://haslab.github.io/Electrum/) framework. Electrum is based on the popular [Alloy](https://alloytools.org) modeling language and analyser, for which we also developed [Alloy4Fun](http://alloy4fun.inesctec.pt), a web application for sharing and learning Alloy. I'm also currently leading a project that aims to develop new analysis techniques for robotic software developed with [ROS](https://www.ros.org), to be integrated in the [HAROS](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros) framework. In the past, my research focused on the topic of model driven software development, namely I helped develop the [Echo](http://haslab.github.io/echo/) framework for model repair and (bidirectional) transformation.

## News

| *02/05/21* | Our [Workshop on Quality and Reliability Assessment of Robotic Software Architectures and Components](https://sites.google.com/view/qrarsac2021) has been accepted at [IROS'21](https://www.iros2021.org/). The live session is scheduled for October 1st, 2021, from 14h to 16h.
| *02/03/21* | [Electrum](http://haslab.github.io/Electrum/) is now part of [Alloy 6](https://github.com/AlloyTools/org.alloytools.alloy)!
| *23/02/21* | A tool paper about the [HAROS](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros) framework has been accepted at [RoSE'21](https://rose-workshops.github.io/rose2021/)!
| *01/07/20* | We've got a paper accepted at [IROS'20](http://www.iros2020.org) about verification of system-wide safety properties of ROS applications!
| *26/03/20* | Some good news amidst this terrible pandemic: we've got two papers accepted at [ABZ'20](https://abz2020.uni-ulm.de), one about [Alloy4Fun](http://alloy4fun.inesctec.pt) and another describing our implementation of the *Adaptive Exterior Light and Speed Control System* case study using [Electrum](http://haslab.github.io/Electrum/). Like many others, the conference itself will be postponed to 2021.
