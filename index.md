# Alcino Cunha

I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Informatics](http://www.di.uminho.pt) of [University of Minho](http://www.uminho.pt). I'm also a member (and currently co-coordinator) of the [High-Assurance Software Laboratory](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/centres/haslab), a research center of [University of Minho](http://www.uminho.pt) and of the [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt) associate laboratory.

## Research

My research aims to help developers build more reliable software. Together with several collaborators at [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt) and [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en/centers/toulouse), I'm currently developing a new formal specification language and analysis tool for software design - the [Electrum](http://haslab.github.io/Electrum/) framework. Electrum is based on the popular [Alloy](https://alloytools.org) modeling language and analyser, for which we also developed [Alloy4Fun](http://alloy4fun.inesctec.pt), a web application for sharing and learning Alloy. I'm also currently leading a project that aims to develop new analysis techniques for robotic software developed with [ROS](https://www.ros.org), to be integrated in the [HAROS](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros) framework. In the past, my research focused on the topic of model driven software development, namely I helped develop the [Echo](http://haslab.github.io/echo/) framework for model repair and (bidirectional) transformation.

## News

| *08/01/20* | Together with Charles Lesire and Michael Fisher I will chair a workshop about *Quality and Reliability Assessment of Robotic Software Architectures and Components* at [ICRA 2020](https://www.icra2020.org). More details coming soon!
| *10/12/19* | My student Bruno Cancelinha successfully defended his MSc dissertation about developing a new analysis backend to our [Electrum](http://haslab.github.io/Electrum/) framework using the [LTSmin](https://ltsmin.utwente.nl) model checker.
| *23/11/19* | My student Chong Liu is heading to [SETTA'19](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csguannan/setta19/), where she will present our paper [Simplifying the Analysis of Software Design Variants with a Colorful Alloy](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35540-1_3). |
